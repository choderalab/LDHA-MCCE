# LDHA-MCCE
MCCE2 calculations for Lactate dehydrogenase A (collaboration with Thompson lab and Gunner lab)

`pdbs` - protein structures of wildtype protein, and two mutants (Q100M and Q100R), for which we want to run calculations.

`epik_data` - epik data for ligand alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) and NADH cofactor. Inside are several folders,
 labeled with `output_pH`, marking the pH of the epik calculation.
